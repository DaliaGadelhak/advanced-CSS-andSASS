Three Pillars of writing Good HTML CSS and BUILDING GOOD WEBSITES:
1.RERSPONSIVE DESIGN
one website that works on all screen sizes
we use:
fluid layouts, media queries, responsive images,
 correct units, desktop-first vs mobile-first






2.MAINAINABLE AND SCALABLE CODE

clean, easy-to-understand,reusable,
how to : organize files, name classes, structure html






3.WEB PERFORMANCE

faster,smaller in size for the user to download less data
how?
less codes, less http requests, compress code,
use css processor (SASS), less and compress images (its takes the biggest part of a website)


all values change into pixels (px)


* 1 rem = 10px

em depends not only on the root font size but on the font size of the current element
ex for rems: in the very begining put in css font-size: 1 rem  

we dont write 0.4 , we write .4

**** veryyyy important  (media queries):
1- rem is very important in media queries

2- put at the begining 
html { font-size: % better than 10px}

3- after that write all in rem

4- when you change the px in html, 
AUTOMATICALLY ALL THE OTHER FONT SIZES IN ""REM"" WILL CHANGE ALSO

5-that's the trick, instead of writing all the media queries and to allow the user
to change the sizes as he whant zoom in, zoom out, small sceens , large ones without 
affecting the style of the content

6- media queries for mobile phones or small screens:
decrease the px in html (AUTOMATICALLY all rem decrease)

6- media queries for mobile phones or bigger screens :
increase the px in html (AUTOMATICALLY all rem increase)

7- DISADVANTAGE OF SETTING: html {font-size: ..px}:
remove the ability of the user to change the default font size of the browser
 
8- so we use the PERCENTAGE % , TO BE according to the browser
  html { font-size: 62.5%}

9- 16 px = 100% (number of px/16 * 100 = %) 
   16px = 1.6 rem = 100% 
   1 rem = 10 px = (10/16)*100 = 62.5%
   10 rem = 100 px = (100/16)*100 = 625%
   2 rem = 20 px = (20/16) * 100 = 125%
   1.4 rem = 14 px = (14/16) * 100 = 87%
